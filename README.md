# Code Jam solutions in Kotlin

This project is just a version of solutions for [Google Code Jam](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/about)
problems written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/).

It requires [JDK 17](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/17/) and [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) to develop and test
the solutions locally. The testing is done directly on Code Jam platform in practice mode.

There is a new solution template `Code Jam Solution` in IDEA templates which might need to be activated in the Settings
under `File and Code Templates` by choosing `Scheme: Project`.

No idea yet how to simplify the local testing for the interactive problems.
